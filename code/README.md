# Happy Thoughts App

A Twitter-inspired app made with React. It fetches data from my own backend API (link at the end of this document).

## Features

- Design based on external guidelines, to practice following it as closely as possible. (NOTE: The UI is based on Technigo's own design.)
- Mobile-first responsive styling.
- Use of flexbox for the layout.
- User input ("happy thoughts") sorted from newest to oldest.
- Use of the hooks useState and useEffect.
- A like button including a counter.

## Challenges and Lessons learned

- Leaving all components in App.js was a mess. So I decided to put them into a separate component (Form.js).
- The time constrains didn't allow for separate CSS components. Something to complete in the future.
